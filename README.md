User Story:
Female Version
Jennifer is an 18 years old girl who just graduated high school. She has the ambition of pursuing a tertiary education in the university so she can become a medical doctor. It has always been her childhood dream. But her parents are not financially buoyant enough to sponsor her university education. Her dad is a security guard in a wealthy man’s house while her mother is a roadside petty trader. She has 5 siblings who are still in high school and she’s the eldest in her family. While she watched her friends make plans for college, she was devastated with no hopes of attending college and becoming the medical doctor she always wanted to be. 

She eventually decided to pick up a job as a househelp to save up for college while applying for scholarships. Through her dad’s connection, she was able to secure a househelp position at the house her dad works as a security guard. While she started working there, her older boss who is in the same age bracket with her father, started making advances at her. After several refusal to his romance advances, he ended up raping her one evening. She was depressed and helpless. He threatened to sack her and her father which in turn will affect the living condition of her family. She was too ashamed to even share her experience with her family or anyone knowing the consequences it will have on her family. She endured the pain and it became a trend. Her boss constantly forces himself on her at will. She was helpless with no voice. A friend stumbled on her diary and read her story. She introduced her to VConnect and she shared her story and also searched for non-profit organizations and government agencies around her who support rape victims and people battling depression. 
Within a few hours, she got calls from free human right lawyers and NGOs who helped her sue her boss for free and she got the justice she deserved. Another NGO registered with Vconnect also helped her seek public funding to raise money for her university education.
